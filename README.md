# linerenderer
A simple 3d line renderer that always faces the camera for godot engine.

Example of it working: https://imgur.com/2QWI2QX

I made this to use points not in the same plan, but in a restrict range, so the artifacts won't show, like in the gif. 

What it has:
- Simplicity
- Color interpolation between start and end
- Thickness interpolation between start and end
- Always faces the camera

What it isn't:
- Unity's line renderer
